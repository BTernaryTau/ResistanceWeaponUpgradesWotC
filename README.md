Gives rewarded and purchased soldiers a chance to have a weapon upgrade already applied when they appear in the armory. WotC version of [this mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=634262789).

Each soldier will only have a maximum of one upgrade. If XCOM has unlocked higher tier weapons for a soldier's class, the upgrade will be applied to the highest tier weapon unlocked. Classes with multiple primary weapon options such as Rangers will have it applied to whichever weapon they default to when they appear in the armory.

By default, eligible soldiers each have a 30% chance of having an upgrade, with basic upgrades being 3 times more likely and advanced upgrades being 2 times more likely to appear than superior upgrades. After running XCOM 2 with the latest version of Resistance Weapon Upgrades loaded, these values can be changed in the XComResistanceWeaponUpgrades.ini file located in your Documents\my games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Config folder. Alternatively, [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300) can be used to edit these options in-game.

The thematic goal of this mod is simply to give resistance soldiers that aren't part of XCOM the ability to duct-tape ADVENT weapon parts to their own weapons, since that doesn't seem like a particularly complicated task to me.
